        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-gray-900">What is Scan to BIM?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Scan to BIM (Building Information Modeling) is the process of converting 3D laser scan data into intelligent, parametric BIM models. This revolutionary workflow transforms point cloud data captured from laser scanners into Revit-ready BIM files that architects, engineers, and construction professionals can use for design, renovation, and facility management.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Unlike traditional manual surveying methods that take weeks and are prone to human error, scan to BIM leverages high-precision laser scanning technology to capture existing building conditions with millimeter-level accuracy. The resulting BIM models provide a complete digital representation of the physical space, including architectural elements, structural components, and MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) systems.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The global scan to BIM market is experiencing rapid growth, valued at approximately <strong>$471 million in 2024</strong> and projected to reach <strong>$673 million by 2031</strong>. This growth is driven by increasing BIM adoption (over 65% in U.S. projects by 2026), advances in AI-powered point cloud processing, and the demand for accurate as-built documentation in renovation and retrofit projects.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Our scan to BIM services deliver significant cost savings by improving accuracy to 1-3mm, reducing field staff requirements by 50-90%, and shortening project timelines by up to 20% while cutting overall costs by 15% through better coordination and clash detection.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">What is the difference between scan to BIM and traditional surveying?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Traditional surveying uses manual measurements and 2D drawings, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Scan to BIM uses laser scanning to capture millions of 3D points in minutes, then converts this data into intelligent 3D BIM models. This process is faster (days vs weeks), more accurate (1-3mm vs 10-50mm), and provides complete documentation of existing conditions.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">What LOD level do I need for my project?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              The appropriate LOD level depends on your project goals. LOD 200 is sufficient for space planning and schematic design. LOD 300 is needed for construction documents and design development. LOD 400 is required for fabrication and detailed coordination. LOD 500 represents as-built conditions for facility management. We'll help you determine the right LOD level based on your specific needs.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Timeline depends on project size and complexity. Small projects (0-1,000 sq ft) typically take 48-96 hours. Medium projects (1,000-5,000 sq ft) take 72-120 hours. Large projects (5,000-25,000 sq ft) take 96-168 hours. Very large projects (25,000+ sq ft) require custom timelines. Rush processing is available for urgent projects.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              We deliver BIM models in Revit (.RVT) format compatible with Revit 2020 or newer. We also provide CAD files (.DWG) for floor plans and reflected ceiling plans. Additional deliverables include point clouds (E57, .XYZ), 3D mesh files (.OBJ), and high-resolution images. All formats are industry-standard and compatible with major design software.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Yes, we can model visible MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) systems from scan data. This includes ductwork, piping, electrical conduits, and fixtures that are visible in the point cloud. For hidden systems behind walls or in ceilings, we document visible access points and note areas requiring additional investigation. MEP modeling is included in our Architecture + MEP and Complete packages.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">How accurate are scan to BIM models?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Accuracy depends on the scanning equipment used. Our Trimble X12 delivers ±1mm accuracy at 25 meters. Matterport Pro 3 provides ±20mm accuracy. NavVis VLX3 offers 5mm accuracy. Point cloud registration and BIM modeling processes maintain this accuracy throughout the workflow. We validate model accuracy against the original point cloud data before delivery.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Yes, scan to BIM is ideal for historic building documentation. We've successfully documented landmark buildings, museums, churches, and heritage sites. Laser scanning captures unique architectural features, ornate details, and irregular geometries that would be difficult to document manually. The resulting BIM models support preservation, restoration, and adaptive reuse projects.

              We provide ongoing support for minor adjustments and clarifications. For significant changes or additions, we offer revision services at competitive rates. Our goal is to ensure you have a BIM model that fully meets your project requirements.
