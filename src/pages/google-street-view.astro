        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-gray-900">What is Google Street View for Business?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Google Street View for Business (also called Google Maps Business View) allows customers to virtually walk through your business location directly on Google Maps and Google Search. Unlike standard Street View imagery that shows only exteriors, Business View captures the interior of your business, giving potential customers a complete virtual experience of your space before they visit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As a <strong>Google Street View Trusted Photographer</strong>, we capture professional 360° photography and 3D virtual tours using Google-approved equipment and processes. These tours are published directly to your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business), making them visible to millions of potential customers searching on Google Maps and Google Search.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When customers search for businesses like yours on Google, they can click on your listing and immediately see an interactive virtual tour of your interior. This immersive experience helps customers understand what to expect, builds trust and confidence, and significantly increases the likelihood that they'll visit your business or contact you.
        </p>
        
        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 mb-6">
          <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">The SEO & Marketing Benefits:</p>
          <ul class="text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>• <strong>Improved Local Search Rankings:</strong> Google integrates virtual tours directly into search results, making your business more prominent in local searches</li>
            <li>• <strong>Higher Engagement:</strong> Business profiles with 25-30 high-quality photos and virtual tours receive significantly more clicks and interactions</li>
            <li>• <strong>Increased Trust:</strong> Authentic interior photos and tours reduce customer hesitation and build credibility</li>
            <li>• <strong>Better Conversion:</strong> Customers who explore virtual tours are more likely to visit or contact your business</li>
            <li>• <strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> Most businesses don't have Street View tours, giving you a significant edge in local search results</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Google Street View for Business is particularly powerful for businesses with physical locations where the interior experience matters - restaurants, retail stores, hotels, gyms, medical offices, and any business where customers want to see what's inside before visiting.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Google integrates virtual tours directly into search results and Google Maps, making your business more prominent in local searches. Businesses with Street View tours often rank higher in "near me" searches and appear more frequently in Google Maps results, leading to increased visibility and discovery by potential customers.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">Higher Customer Engagement</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Business profiles with 25-30 high-quality photos and virtual tours receive significantly more clicks and interactions. Customers spend more time exploring your listing, which signals to Google that your business is relevant and engaging. This increased engagement can improve your search rankings and drive more qualified traffic.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Virtual tours show transparency and authenticity, helping potential customers feel more confident about visiting your business. When customers can see your interior before visiting, they know what to expect, reducing hesitation and building trust. This is especially important for businesses where the interior experience matters.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">Local SEO Boost</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Google's algorithm considers visual content and user engagement when ranking businesses in local search results. Virtual tours and high-quality photos are strong ranking signals that can improve your position in local search results, Google Maps, and "near me" searches. This SEO benefit compounds over time as more customers engage with your tour.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Most businesses don't have Google Street View tours, giving you a significant competitive edge. When customers compare businesses in search results, your virtual tour makes you stand out and appear more professional and trustworthy. This differentiation can be the deciding factor that drives customers to choose your business over competitors.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Customers who explore virtual tours are more likely to visit your business or contact you. The immersive experience helps customers make informed decisions, leading to higher-quality leads and better conversion rates. Virtual tours also reduce "no-shows" by helping customers confirm your business meets their needs before visiting.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">What's the difference between Google Street View and Matterport virtual tours?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Google Street View tours are published directly to Google Maps and Google Search, making them visible to millions of potential customers searching on Google. Matterport virtual tours are more detailed 3D experiences that can be embedded on your website, shared via links, and used for various marketing purposes. Many businesses use both - Google Street View for Google visibility and <a href="/3d-virtual-tour" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Matterport tours</a> for website and marketing use.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-900">Do I need to have a Google Business Profile?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Yes, you need to have a Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) to publish a Street View tour. If you don't have one yet, we can help you set it up. The Google Business Profile is free and essential for local SEO and Google Maps visibility. Once your profile is verified, we can publish your virtual tour.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Yes! If you make significant changes to your space, we can rescan and update your Google Street View tour.
